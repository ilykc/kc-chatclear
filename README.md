# kc-clearchat 
My edit of an older chat clearing script with some added features and made it more compatiable with custom chat scripts.


# Installation
    - Download the zip and extract the folder
    - If needed, rename the folder to from "kc-clearchat-master" to "kc-clearchat"
    - Place in your folder called [standalone]
    - Make sure you have ensure [standalone]  inside your server.cfg
    - Inside your server.cfg add the following code under any admin permission section.

                   ## Chat Permissions ##
          add_ace group.admin chat.clear allow # allow chat commands
    
    - Restart server and done.
    - Command: /clearchat


# This script will not receive frequent updates unless qb-core makes changes to their framework that would make it incompatible.

# This script will not be receiving any support as it is a simple drag, drop and copy paste.
